# Tur sample fixtures

Small hand-crafted fixtures that exercise the Tur commentary merger without
requiring the large Git LFS JSON sources. They model the Even HaEzer section
with two simanim and a Beit Yosef commentary so the script can be exercised in
CI or local development environments where the full data set is unavailable.
