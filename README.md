I prepared a README.md draft based on the repository description and language breakdown. If you want, I can now add this file to the main branch (commit it), or modify the content first — for example:

- Add installation or run instructions for any specific scripts
- Mention Python version or dependencies (requirements.txt)
- Add a CC0 license badge or shields.io markup
- Expand the "What's included" section with actual filenames or directories if you tell me which ones to highlight

Tell me to "Add README" to commit it as-is, or tell me what to change.
